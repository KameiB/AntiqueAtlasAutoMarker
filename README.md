## AntiqueAtlasAutoMarker

Antique Atlases are great, but don't you hate having to mark everything yourself?

This mod adds a lot of automatic marking features for the Antique Atlas.

### Features clientside
- Automatic marking of activated Waystones, 
  - with an option to auto rename the marker when the waystone is renamed.

### Features serverside (needs mod on server)
- Automatic marking of newly generated wild waystones near to a player.
- Automatic marking of dragon roosts (Ice&Fire, any 1.12 version including RLCraft+RotN)
- Automatic marking of cyclops dens (Ice&Fire, same)

### Planned features

- Automatic marking of hydra lairs (I&F)
- Automatic marking of roguelike dungeons
- Automatic marking of doomlike dungeons
- Automatic marking of lycanite dungeons
- Automatic marking of Ruins mod structures
